# machine-learning

About: This project is to document my journey into machine learning from ground zero, relying solely on publicly available resources. The assumption is that someone with absolutely no experience and no introduction to machine learning will be able to repeat these steps. 

POA:
1. Requirements as a Machine Learning expert (aka, what do you need to know?)
2. Where to start: collect all of the resources publicly available
3. Pick a crash course to start with
4. What platform to use? What's available?
5. Complete a small project: Start with a project in mind: Pick a problem I'm genuinely interested in. What do I need to learn in order to complete this project?

Results:
I. Machine Learning Requirements: these are gathered from a collection of course syllabi and machine learning job listings. Ultimately, What do you need to know how to do in order to say you actually "know machine learning"? (as an engineer, I'm going to list it as Requirements with specs in parenthesis, specs being the physical thing (program/language/equation/software) you can check off as something you know/need to learn)

  Requirements (Specificationss):
a. Computer Science Fundamentals/Programming (data structures, algorithms, computability and complexity, Languages:
b. Probability/Statistics (
c. Data Modeling and Evaluation (folds, cross-validation, and metrics such as F1 score)
d. Applying Machine Learning Algorithms and Libraries
e. Software Engineering and System Design (library calls, REST APIs, database queries)

Specs:
1. Object-oriented languages: Python, Go, Java, or C++...
2. Machine learning and building scalable production services (NLP, APIs, classification, feature selection, clustering, neural networks, etc.)
3. Distributed storage and database systems: SQL or NoSQL, MySQL, or Cassandra
  -Distributed Data Frameworks: Dask, Spark or Hadoop
4. Machine learning libraries or platforms: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Gensim, Tensorflow, Caffe, Theanos, Scikit-Learn, or ML Lib for production or commercial products
